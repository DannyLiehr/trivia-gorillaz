# GZ Trivia
JS project that makes a never-ending multiple choice game. Players guess the member of Gorillaz based on some out-of-context, ridiculous quote. I've been a fan for years, so I figured I should know plenty of ridiculous things that have been said.

To DO:
- [ ] Create infinite loop to perpetually go through quotes.
- [ ] Store trivia in JSON or other format. (Array of sets?)
- [ ] The stored data should add a source so people can make sure. Likewise: *find sources for these quotes.* Can't be bothered through the metaphorical swamp waters known as Gorillaz' writing at this moment.
- [ ] 2 Hint system. The hint should remove one **incorrect** answer from the list of choices. At the end, the player should only have **two choices**: The right one and the wrong one.
- [ ] Score system. Might not use `localStorage` and instead reset on refresh.
- [ ] **When all is said and done:** add graphics.
